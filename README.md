# RilCritch's dotfiles
#### Author: RilCritch (Riley Critchfield)

## Description
These are my dotfiles for an archlinux system. I am using ArcoLinuxB AwesomeWM variant. These dotfiles will change drastically as I decide to overhaul my entire system. I plan to make backups of full rices I make when I'm down with them. Im always tweaking my shit, so this repo is ever changing and evolving.

## Info
I plan to add info of what applicatons and software I using in these dots. Also, I will add explanations of how everything works together and how I set stuff up. This will act as semi documentation to help me remeber how to set everything up.

## NO LONGER IN USE
I've split my configurations up into more repositories, so this repository is no deprecated
